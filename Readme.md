Aspiring Digital Artisan & Hobbyist Systems Stress-Tester

I maintain a... * passionate*... relationship with my hardware. I believe in the therapeutic value of a fresh start, applied liberally and frequently.
🔧 What I Do (According to Me)

    📸 Photography (I argue with light sensors)

    🎬 Video Editing (I make Premiere Pro cry)

    💻 Programming (import sanity failed)

    🛠️ Computer Hardware (It's not hoarding if it's PCIe)

    🔒 Cybersecurity (My digital kingdom has a moat of sudo commands)

🏋️ My Daily Driver(s)

I run a multi-OS setup on a trilogy of ThinkPads because I don't believe in commitment.

The Holy Trinity:

    P15 (The Beast): For when I need to render a video AND my self-esteem simultaneously.

    T480 (The Mule): Faithfully carries my code between coffee shops.

    X1 Yoga (The Fancy One): For pretending I'm a professional in meetings.
